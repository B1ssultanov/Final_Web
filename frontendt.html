                Front-End Developer Roadmap - Top Skills A Front-End Developer Should Have
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                Let us now look at the frontend roadmap which will serve as a guide regtarding the skills you need to
                learn to become a front end developer. We recommend a front end web developer online course to shorten
                your learning curve.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title-content">
                1. Learn the Fundamentals - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            </h2>


            <p class="p">
                As we saw earlier, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three of the fundamental skills to become a
                front-end developer. Thus, you must make yourself familiar and comfortable with these three skills.
                This is the very first step in our front end road map. While HTML and CSS can be learned easily,
                JavaScript could be challenging, especially if you have no prior programming experience. You should
                get comfortable with other fundamental skills mentioned earlier - DOM Manipulation, Responsive
                Design, and working of the web.
            </p>

                    alt="img">
            </div>



            <h2 class="title-content">
                2. Learn any of the CSS Frameworks
            </h2>

            <!-- <div class="content-info__wrapper"> -->

            <p class="p">
                Once you are comfortable with the basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is time to move on to the
                next
                step in the roadmap for frontend, that is learning any of the CSS Frameworks. These frameworks would
                speed up the development process for you. One challenge that front end developers face is to
                maintain
                styling consistency in their web pages. CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Tailwind,
                Semantic
                UI, Bulma, etc. make it easier to develop a consistent website. They consist of several CSS
                stylesheets
                that are ready to use, allowing developers to save time that is otherwise spent in styling a
                website.
                These stylesheets are user-friendly and visually appealing and have built-in classes for common web
                elements like navbars, headers, footers, menus, etc.
            </p>

            </div>



            <h2 class="title-content">
                3. Learn any of the CSS Preprocessors
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                CSS files can quickly become huge and difficult to maintain. Moreover, CSS doesn’t support some powerful
                programming features like variables and functions. Thus, we make use of CSS preprocessors that are
                scripting languages, extending the default capabilities of CSS. The extended CSS code is compiled and
                the output is the regular CSS file. With the help of CSS preprocessors, we can use logic in our script
                files like variables, functions, mixins, inheritance, nesting inheritance, and mathematical
                calculations. This automates repetitive tasks and reduces the number of errors, and creates reusable
                code. SASS/SCSS, Stylus, and Less are a few popular preprocessors.
            </p>

            </div>



            <h2 class="title-content">
                4. Learn any JavaScript Framework
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                JavaScript framework is pre-written code to support features and benefits beyond plain or vanilla
                JavaScript. As these frameworks are built on top of JavaScript, it is possible to achieve all the
                features of a framework with normal JavaScript as well. However, these frameworks offer enhanced
                functionality without writing the code from scratch. This is the reason why Front End Developers usually
                prefer using a framework over plain JavaScript. Angular, React, Vue.js, Meteor are some of the popular
                JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. You can also find specialized roles in React, Angular,
                or Vue.js.
            </p>

            </div>



            <h2 class="title-content">
                5. Learn State Management Libraries
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                Along with any JavaScript Framework, it is recommended to learn State Management Libraries like Redux,
                VueX, NgRX, XState, etc. depending on which framework you choose to learn. Certain state management
                libraries can only be used with specific frameworks - for example, NgRX is a Redux based library that is
                specifically made for Angular applications.
                <br />
                All the interactive web applications work by responding to “events”. When a certain event occurs, the
                “state” of your application, i.e. the data stored in variables, gets updated. The variables that
                determine the state of your interactive web application need to be stored somewhere. This is where State
                Management comes into picture. It deals with storing and updating the state of the application.

            <h2 class="title-content">
                6. Learn the basics of Package Managers
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                While working on Front End Development, you will come across Package Managers. A Package Manager is a
                tool that allows you to install, configure, update and manage software packages, product dependencies
                and also to publish your own packages. With the use of Package Managers, the development process is
                faster and easier as you can reuse code libraries created by other developers that are published to a
                central repository. NPM and Yarn are two popular package managers. You should learn the basic commands
                of any of the Package Managers.
            </p>

                7. Learn Version Control System
            </h2>

            <p class="p">
                A Version Control System is useful if you are working on a large project or need to collaborate with
                other developers. It is a software that allows you to manage and track changes to the source code and
                also revert to a previous version of the code, instead of manually reverting the changes. It enhances
                the development speed and experience as you spend less time managing the code, reduces possibilities of
                code conflicts, and helps to recover your code in case you want to revert to a previous version. Git is
                one of the most popular and widely used version control systems.
